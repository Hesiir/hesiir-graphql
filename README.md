# Enviroment

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE. For example:

```bash
DOMAIN          = localhost
PROJECT         = project
PORT            = 3000
DEBUG           = true
FETCHAPI        = fetch_domain
WHITELIST       = allow_domain
```
